Categorical Ordinal vs. Categorical Nominal <br/>
We can divide categorical data further into two types: Ordinal and Nominal.<br/>

Categorical Ordinal data take on a ranked ordering (like a ranked interaction on a scale from Very Poor to Very Good with the dogs).<br/>

Categorical Nominal data do not have an order or ranking (like the breeds of the dog).<br/>

#### Another Look<br/>
To break down our data types, there are two main blocks:<br/>

Quantitative and Categorical<br/>

Quantitative can be further divided into Continuous or Discrete.<br/>

Categorical data can be divided into Ordinal or Nominal.<br/>

You should have now mastered what types of data in the world around us falls into each of these four buckets: Discrete, Continuous, Nominal, and Ordinal. In the next sections, we will work through the numeric summaries that relate specifically to quantitative variables.<br/>
